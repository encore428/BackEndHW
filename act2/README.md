# Activity 2
- Set up a server as previously but with Express.js such that
browser side, at localhost:5000, if a name is submitted,
the user receives a “Welcome <name>!” page.
- If an empty name is submitted, a 401 error should be
triggered and the server should send back an “Please
provide something” message.
- Make use of routers in order to make the code as clean
and modular as possible.
